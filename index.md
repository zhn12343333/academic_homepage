## Hello

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) and am also working as an intern at [Fabu Technology](https://www.fabu.ai/).

My research interests are centered around computer vision and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT)** in recent studies.




## News
I haven't published any papers yet
