I am currently pursuing my Master's in Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) and am also working as an intern at [Feibu Technology](https://www.fabu.ai/).

My research interests are centered around computer vision and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) in recent studies.
